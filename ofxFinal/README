Our justice system is pretty f***** up.

​

The truth is subject to the talent of a defense attorney, the impressions and prejudices of the jury and the ultimate decision of the judge. Rarely is the truth just simply that, the truth. Irrefutable. In our criminal justice system, we try as it may to rely on the facts and evidence. However, technicalities can easily dismiss them all.



Today's society is becoming increasingly dependent on the use of technology. We've turned to its power of data collection and now refer it it as concrete and irrefutable as the truth. To combat the margins of error currently present in our criminal justice system, we've begun to turn to algorithms for the truth. The power of the judicial system, thus, lies within the power of the algorithm, or rather, the one who's responsible for coding it. And since this person is indeed humans, these algorithms that we thought of as the know all be all, are subject to the same human fallacies that we're currently facing. However, these decisions go unchallenged. Do you see how this could be a problem?

​

The objective of this project is to provoke user's into the dangers of relying solely upon technology to determine's one justice.
